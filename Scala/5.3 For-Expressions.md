To motivate this topic, let's consider the following task:

For a given positive integer `n`, we want to create an expression which generates all pairs of positive integers `(i, j)` with `1 <= j < i < n` such that `i + j` is prime.

To do this we could:
- Generate all the integers between `1` and `n` (exclusive),
- for each integer `i`, generate the list of pairs 
  ```
  (i, 1), ..., (i, i-1)
  ```

This can be achieved with `until` and `map`:
```Scala
(1 until n)
	.flatMap(i => (1 until i).map(j => (i, j)))
```
which, thanks to using `flatMap`, puts all the pairs into one list.

Now we can use the `isPrime` method defined [[5.2 More Collections#Prime Numbers|here]] to complete the expression:
```Scala
(1 until n)
	.flatMap(i => (1 until i).map(j => (i, j)))
	.filter((x, y) => isPrime(x + y))
```

This works, but it's very convoluted and kind of hard to read.

# For-Expressions
`for` expressions are a powerful notation in Scala to help with situations as described in the example.

## Syntax
A for-expression is of the form:
```Scala
for s yield e
```
where `s` is a sequence of *generators* and *filters* and `e` is an expression whose value is returned by one iteration.

- A *generator* is of the form `p <- c`, where `p` is a pattern and `c` an expression whose value is a collection.
- A *filter* is of the form `if f` where `f` is a boolean expression.
- The sequence must start with a generator.
- If there are several generators in the sequence, the last generators vary faster than the first.

## Simple Example
Let `persons` be a list of elements of class `Person`:
```Scala
case class Person(name: String, age: Int)
```

To obtain all names of persons over 20 years old, write:
```Scala
for p <- persons if p.age > 20
yield p.name
```

## Back to Primes
Now we can make our introductory example much more concise and easier to read:
```Scala
for 
	i <- 1 until n
	j <- 1 until i
	if isPrime(i + j)
yield (i, j)
```

### Rewriting `scalarProduct`
The `scalarProduct` function defined [[5.2 More Collections#Scalar Product on Vectors|here]] can also be rewritten now:
```Scala
def scalarProduct(xs: List[Double], ys: List[Double]) : Double =
	(for ((x, y) <- xs.zip(ys)) yield x * y).sum
```

## Combinatorial Search 
On [[scala-week5.pdf#page=78|slides 78 - 81]] is a good example about using for-expressions to tackle the *N-Queens* problem.
