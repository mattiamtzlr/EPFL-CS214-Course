#scala #data-structures 

Until now, the data structures we have seen are [[4.3 Scala Lists, Tuples|Lists and Tuples]]. These are not always ideal though, as lists for example are *linear* and thus also have an access time of `O(n)`.

# Vectors
*Vectors* are created analogously to lists:
```Scala
val nums = Vector(72, -13,  37, 42)
val people = Vector("Alice", "Bob", "Trudy")
```

They support the same operations as lists, with the exception of `::`; Instead of `x :: xs` there is
- `x +: xs` which creates a new vector with leading element `x`, followed by all elements in `xs`.
- `xs :+ x` which creates a new vector with trailing element `x`, preceded by all elements in `xs`.

A common base class of `List` and `Vector` is the `Seq`, the class of all *sequences*.

# Arrays
*Arrays* are very similar to strings and they both support the same operations as `Seq`. They can also be implicitly converted to sequences when needed.

Array declaration:
```Scala
val xs: Array[Int] = Array(1, 2, 3)
xs.map(x => 2 * x)
```

# Ranges
A *range* is another simple kind of sequence, which represents a sequence of *evenly* spaced integers.

There are three operators: `to` (inclusive), `until` (exclusive) and `by` to determine the step value:
```Scala
val r: Range = 1 until 5 // {1, 2, 3, 4}
val s: Range = 1 to 10 by 3 // {1, 4, 7, 10}
```
A `Range` is a single object with three fields, a lower bound, an upper bound and a step value.

# Sequence Operations
A list of some more methods defined on sequences can be found on [[scala-week5.pdf#page=55|this slide]].

## Sorting
One of the most useful operations is sorting achieved by either of the following:
```Scala
val fruit = List("apple", "pear", "orange", "pineapple")

> fruit.sortWith(_.length < _.length)
  -> List("pear", "apple", "orange", "pineapple")

> fruit.sorted // natural order
  -> List("apple", "orange", "pear", "pineapple")
```

## Grouping
Another very useful operation is grouping, achieved by the following:
```Scala
> fruit.groupBy(_.head)
  -> Map(
	  'p' -> List("pear", "pineapple"),
	  'a' -> List("apple"),
	  'o' -> List("orange")
	 )
```

# Examples
## Combinations
Generate a list of all combinations `(x, y)` where `x` is drawn from `1..m` and `y` from `1..n`:
```Scala
(1 to m).flatMap(x => (1 to n).map(y => (x, y)))
```

## Scalar Product on Vectors
Compute the scalar product of two vectors `xs` and `ys`:
```Scala
def scalarProduct(xs: Vector[Double], ys: Vector[Double]): Double =
	xs.zip(ys).map((x, y) => x * y).sum
```

## Prime Numbers
Check whether a given number `n` is prime, by checking that all numbers smaller than `n` do not divide `n`:
```Scala
def isPrime(n: Int): Boolean =
	(2 until n).forall(n % _ != 0)
```

# Sets
*Sets* are written analogously to sequences:
```Scala
val fruit = Set("apple", "banana", "pear")
val s = (1 to 6).toSet
```
Most operations on sequences are also available on sets.

The main difference between sets and sequences are:
1. Sets are unordered
2. Sets don't have duplicates
3. The fundamental operation on sets is contains, meaning:
   ```Scala
   s(2) === s.contains(2)
   ```

# Maps
One of the most useful collection type is a *map*, which is of type `Map[K, V]`, a data structure that associates keys of type `K` with values of type `V`:
```Scala
val romanNumerals = Map(
	"I" -> 1,
	"V" -> 5,
	"X" -> 10
)
val capitals = Map(
	"US"          -> "Washington",
	"Switzerland" -> "Bern"
)
```

Maps conform to the collection type `Iterable[(K, V)]`, meaning maps support the same operations as other iterables, for example `map`.

The fundamental operation on Maps is `apply` which works very similarly to `get` but throws an exception if the key can't be found whereas `get` returns an `Option` type:
```Scala
> capitals("US")
  -> "Washington"

> capitals("Andorra")
  -> java.util.NoSuchElementException

> capitals.get("US")
  -> Some("Washington")

> capitals.get("Andorra")
  -> None
```

## Map operations
Functional updates are done using the `+` and `++` operators:
- `m > (k -> v)`: The map `m`, updated to include the mapping `k -> v`.
- `m1 ++ m2`: The map `m1`, updated with all key/value pairs in `m2`.
