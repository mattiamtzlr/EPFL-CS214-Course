Using combinatorial operations on collections is usually shorter and simpler than using a recursive approach.
However, it is **terrible from a performance standpoint**, as we often construct very large collections, even though we only need a small part of it.

# Lazy Lists
We can make such code efficient by using this trick.

This idea is implemented in the `LazyList` class. A `LazyList` is similar to a normal `List`, but its elements are evaluated only *on demand*.
This is in contrast to the other two evaluation strategies, [[1.2 Scala Basics#call-by-value (CBV) vs call-by-name (CBN)|by-value and by-name]] seen until now.

## Defining Lazy Lists
Lazy lists are defined from a constant `LazyList.empty` and a constructor `LazyList.cons`, for example:
```Scala
val lazyXs = LazyList.cons(1, LazyList.cons(2, LazyList.empty))
```
which is equivalent to
```Scala
val lazyXs = 1 #:: 2 #:: LazyList.empty
```
thanks to the `x #:: xs` alias for `LazyList.cons(x, xs)`.

Alternatively, they can be defined using the `LazyList` object as a factory:
```Scala
val lazyXs = LazyList(1, 2)
```

---

The `to(LazyList)` method will turn the collection it has been called on into a lazy list:
```Scala
> (1 to 1000).to(LazyList)
  -> val res0: LazyList[Int] = LazyList(<not computed>)
```

## Operations on Lazy Lists
`LazyList` supports almost all methods of `List`, such as `range`, `filter`, etc.
See [[4.3 Scala Lists, Tuples#Operations on Lists]] for more information.
