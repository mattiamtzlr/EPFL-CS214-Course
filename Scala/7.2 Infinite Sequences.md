The previously discussed [[7.1 Lazy Lists, Evaluation#Lazy Evaluation|lazy evaluation]] and lazy lists open up the possibility for **infinite-sized sequences**.

# Infinite Lists
For example, we can define the lazy list of all integers starting from a given number as such:
```Scala
def from(n: Int): LazyList[Int] = n #:: from(n + 1)
```
which we can use to get the list of all natural numbers:
```Scala
> val naturals = from(0)
  -> val naturals: LazyList[Int] = LazyList(<not computed>)
```
and then the list of all multiples of 4:
```Scala
> naturals.map(_ * 4)
  -> val res1: LazyList[Int] = LazyList(<not computed>)
```

## Example: Sieve of Eratosthenes
