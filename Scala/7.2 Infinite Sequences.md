The previously discussed [[7.1 Lazy Lists, Evaluation#Lazy Evaluation|lazy evaluation]] and lazy lists open up the possibility for **infinite-sized sequences**.

# Infinite Lists
For example, we can define the lazy list of all integers starting from a given number as such:
```Scala
def from(n: Int): LazyList[Int] = n #:: from(n + 1)
```
which we can use to get the list of all natural numbers:
```Scala
> val naturals = from(0)
  -> val naturals: LazyList[Int] = LazyList(<not computed>)
```
and then the list of all multiples of 4:
```Scala
> naturals.map(_ * 4)
  -> val res1: LazyList[Int] = LazyList(<not computed>)
```

## Example: Sieve of Eratosthenes
The [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) is an ancient technique to calculate prime numbers. 

> [!Example]- Algorithm: Sieve of Eratosthenes
> 1. Start with all integers from 2 (which is the first prime number)
> 2. Eliminate all multiples of 2.
> 3. The first element of the resulting list which wasn't eliminated is 3, the next prime number.
> 4. Eliminate all multiples of 3.
> 5. Iterate forever. At each step, the first not-eliminated number is a prime number and we eliminate each of its duplicates.

Below is the Scala implementation of this algorithm:
```Scala
def sieve(s: LazyList[Int]): LazyList[Int] = 
  s.head #:: sieve(s.tail.filter(_ % s.head != 0))

val primes = sieve(from(2))
```
which uses the `from` function defined above.

To get the first `N` prime numbers as a `List` write:
```Scala
primes.take(N).toList
```

## Example: Square Roots
In week 1 we defined a [[1.3 Recursion, Nested Functions|square root function using Newton's method]], where we used a `isGoodEnough` function to check whether the result has converged far enough to stop the computation.
With lazy lists we can now express this notion of a *converging sequence* without having to worry about when to terminate it:
```Scala
def sqrtSeq(x: Double): LazyList[Double] =
  def improve(guess: Double) = (guess + x / guess) / 2
  lazy val guesses: LazyList[Double] = 1 #:: guesses.map(improve)
  guesses
```
Note that we have *defined `guesses` in terms of itself*, which is only possible thanks to it being evaluated lazily (`lazy val` declaration).
This notion essentially constructs the `guesses` list by repeatedly mapping the current head to `improve`.

We can then add our termination function `isGoodEnough` later:
```Scala
def isGoodEnough(guess: Double, x: Double) =
  ((guess * guess - x) / x).abs < 0.0001
```
And we would then use the `sqrtSeq` function as follows:
```Scala
> sqrtSeq(2).filter(isGoodEnough(_, 2))
  -> val res0: LazyList[Double] = LazyList(<not computed>)

> res0.head
  -> val res1: Double = 1.4142156862745097 
```

## Case Study: Water Pouring Puzzle
See slides 54 - 92 for a case study using lazy evaluation and lazy lists about a water pouring puzzle: ![[scala-week7.pdf#page=54|slides 54 - 92]]

#software-engineering 

The **main takeaways** from that case study are:
- Turn actions into data.
- Define possibly infinite set of actions / solutions / strategies / etc. as a lazy data structure, most probably a `LazyList`.
    - This makes it possible to traverse and search concisely and legibly.
- There are usually multiple correct representations for data, some shorter, some more efficient.

**General principles for good design:**
- Name everything you can
- Put operations into natural scopes
- Keep degrees of freedom for future refinements

These principles are especially useful the more complex the code we are writing gets.
