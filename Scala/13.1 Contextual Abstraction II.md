#scala 

Until now, when talking about [[10.3 Contextual Abstraction I|contextual abstraction]], we mostly saw code following this pattern:
```Scala
trait Ordering[A]:
  def compare(x: A, y: A): Int

object Ordering:
  given Int: Ordering[Int] with
    def compare(x: Int, y: Int) =
      if x < y then -1 else if x > y then 1 else 0

  given String: Ordering[String] with
    def compare(x: String, y: String) = s.compareTo(t)

  given List: [T](using Ordering[T]): Ordering[List[T]] with
    def compare(x: List[T], y: List[T]) = ...
```
<br>

# Type Classes
#terminology 

We say that `Ordering` is a *type class*, which - in Scala - is a generic trait that comes with `given` instances for type instances of that trait.

Type classes provide yet another form of *polymorphism*, they can be used with all types for which there is a `given` instance. The specific implementation is resolved by the compiler at compile-time.
This is sometimes called *ad-hoc polymorphism*.
<br>

## Context Bounds
To use a `given` instance in a function, we use the `using TypeClass[T]` syntax, which is so common that there is an abbreviation for it:
```Scala
def sort[T: Ordering](xs: List[T]): List[T] = ...
         ^^^^^^^^^^^
```
which, in words, means that `sort` works for all types `T` that have an `Ordering`.

---

Context bounds can be used in [[10.3 Contextual Abstraction I#Conditional Instances|conditional]] `given` instances:
```Scala
given listOrdering[T: Ordering]: Ordering[List[T]] with ...
given pairOrdering[A: Ordering, B: Ordering]: Ordering[(A, B)] with ...
```
<br>

## Retroactive Extension
Let's say, we want to add an instance of the `Ordering` type class for the `Rational` type, which we have used before:
```Scala
case class Rational(number: Int, denom: Int)

given Ordering[Rational] with
  def compare(x: Rational, y: Rational) = 
    Ordering.Int.compare(x.numer * y.denom, y.numer * x.denom)
```

We were able to implement `Ordering[Rational]` without changing the definition of the `Rational` class. This is because type classes support *retroactive extension*: the ability to extend a data type with new operations without changing its definition.
Caveat: These retroactive extensions need to be defined or imported explicitly.
<br>

## Type Classes and Extension Methods
Like any trait, a type class trait may define *extension methods*, for instance, the `Ordering` trait would usually contain comparison methods:
```Scala
trait Ordering[A]:
  def compare(x: A, y: A): Int

  extension (x: A)
    def <  (y: A): Boolean = compare(x, y) < 0
    def <= (y: A): Boolean = compare(x, y) <= 0
    def >  (y: A): Boolean = compare(x, y) > 0
    def >= (y: A): Boolean = compare(x, y) >= 0
```
These are visible, whenever a `given` instance for the trait is available.
<br>

## Summary
- Type classes provide a way to *turn types into values*.
  <br>

- Unlike  class extensions, type classes
  - can be defined at any time without changing existing code,
  - can be conditional
    <br>

- In Scala, we construct type classes from parameterized traits and `given` instances.
  <br>

- Type classes provide a new kind of polymorphism, which is sometimes called *ad-hoc* polymorphism. This means that `TC[A]` has different implementations for different types `A`.
  <br>

# Context Passing
Passing context is often about implicitly parameterising over values that can have a simple type, to answer the question
> What is the currently valid definition of type `T`?

We could for example use context passing to propagate
- the current configuration,
- the available set of capabilities / functions,
- the security level,
- etc.
<br>

## Case Study: Conference Management System
Slides 29 to 41 go into the details of context passing by looking at a case study about a management system designed to discuss papers submitted to a conference:
![[scala-week13.pdf#page=29|slides 29 - 41]]
<br>

## Opaque Type Aliases
We can define a type alias as being *opaque*,
```Scala
object ConfManagement:
  opaque type Viewers = Set[Person]
```
which leads to the equation `Viewers = Set[Person]` only being *defined within the scope* where the alias is defined, in this case in the `ConfManagement` object.
Everywhere else, Viewers is treated as a *separate, abstract* type.
<br>

**Remarks**:
- This helps against data tampering, as it is impossible to create instances of the type outside of where it has been defined, thus only *trusted* data is used in the object.
  <br>
- However, this only works, if we can assume that there are no nested usages of the type, as then the inner usage could access the value of the outer one.
  <br>
- When using an opaque type as an *implicit parameter*, there's no chance to connect that implicit parameter with any other `given` instance by accident, as it is impossible to create one outside the scope.
  <br>

## `given` Instances must be specific!
`given` instances should have *specific types* and/or should be *local in the scope*. For example, the following is a terrible idea:

> [!warning] &nbsp; WARNING: bad code ahead
> ```Scala
> given Int = 1
> def f(x: Int)(using delta: Int) = x + delta
> ```

If someone else were to define a `given` instance for `Int`, how would we know which one gets implicitly used by `f`?

**Never** use a common type such as `Int` or `String` as the type of a *globally visible* `given` instance.
