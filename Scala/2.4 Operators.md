For this topic, we will continue using the [[2.3 Data and Classes#Motivational example|motivational example about rationals]].  

The problem that still persists with that example is the fact that there is a notable difference in how the `Rational` objects are used in comparison to integers for example. 
Even though they are just as natural, if we want to add two rational `r` and `s` numbers we have to use the syntax
```Scala
r.add(s)
```
instead of being able to just write `r + s`.

# Relaxed identifiers
Operators such as `+` or `<` count as identifiers in Scala.
Thus an identifier can be:
- *Alphanumeric*: starting with a letter, followed by a sequence of letters or numbers.
	- The underscore character `_` counts as a letter.
	- Alphanumeric identifiers can also end in an underscore, followed by some operator symbols.
	<br>
	
- *Symbolic*: starting with an operator symbol, followed by other operator symbols.

Some examples of identifiers include
```
x1    *    +?%&    vector_++    counter_=
```
<hr>

## Operators as method names
Since operators are identifiers, it's possible to use them as method names. Thus for our `Rational` class we can define an extension which takes advantage of that:

```Scala
extension (x: Rational)
	def + (y: Rational): Rational = x.add(y)
	def * (y: Rational): Rational = x.mul(y)
	...
```

This allows rational numbers to be used like `Int` or `Double`:
```Scala
val x = Rational(1, 2)
val y = Rational(1, 3)
x * x + y * y
```
<br>

# Infix Notation
An operator method with a single parameter can be used as an *infix operator*.
An alphanumeric method with a single parameter can also be used as an infix operator **if** it is declared with an `infix` modifier. E.g.
```Scala
extension (x: Rational)
	infix def min(that: Rational): Rational = ...
```
This can then be used as follows:
```Scala
r min s    /* instead of */    r.min(s)
```
<br>

# Precedence
The *precedence* of an operator is determined by its first character. The following lists the characters in increasing order of priority:
```
(all letters)
|
^
&
< >
= !
:
+ -
* / %
(all other special characters)
```
