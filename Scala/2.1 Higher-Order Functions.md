#terminology 

Functional languages treat functions as *first-class* values, meaning that, like any other value, a function can be passed as a parameter and be returned as a result.  
Thus, programs can be flexibly composed, and functions which take other functions as parameters or that return functions as results are called *higher order functions*.

# Motivational Example - Sums
The following function calculates the sum of the integers between `a` and `b`:
```Scala
def sumInts(a: Int, b:Int): Int =
	if a > b then 0 else a + sumInts(a + 1, b)
```
It does this, by [[1.3 Recursion, Nested Functions#Recursive Functions|recursively]] summing `a`, `a + 1`, ..., `b`.

These next functions calculate the sum of the cubes of all the integers between `a` and `b`:
```Scala
def cube(x: Int): Int = x * x * x

def sumCubes(a: Int, b: Int): Int =
	if a > b then 0 else cube(a) + sumCubes(a + 1, b)
```
And finally, to calculate the sum of the factorials of all the integers between `a` and `b`:
```Scala
def sumFactorials(a: Int, b: Int): Int =
	if a > b then 0 else factorial(a) + sumFactorials(a + 1, b)
```

# Higher-Order Functions (HOFs)
We can see that all the functions in the [[#Motivational Example - Sums|above example]] are all just cases of
$$\sum_{n = a}^b f(n)$$
for different values of the function $f$.
<hr>

So, let's use a higher-order function to simplify these functions. Let's define:
```Scala
def sum(f: Int => Int, a: Int, b: Int): Int =
	if a > b then 0
	else f(a) + sum(f, a + 1, b)
```
Then, we can simplify:
```Scala
def sumInts(a: Int, b:Int)  = sum(id, a, b)
def sumCubes(a: Int, b:Int) = sum(cube, a, b)
def sumFacts(a: Int, b:Int) = sum(fact, a, b)
```
where
```Scala
def id(x: Int):   Int = x
def cube(x: Int): Int = x * x * x
def fact(x: Int): Int = if x == 0 then 1 else x * fact(x - 1)
```

## Function Types
The type `A => B` used above is the type of a function taking an argument of type `A` and returning a result of type `B`.  
Thus, `Int => Boolean` maps from integers to booleans.

## Anonymous Functions
An anonymous function has the following general syntax:
```
({argument: Type}) => body
```
So, for example a simple `add` function:
```Scala
(x: Int, y: Int) => x + y
```
If the type of the parameter(s) can be inferred by the compiler, it can also be omitted.

An anonymous function can always be expressed using `def`:
$$(x_1 \space : \space T_1, \space ..., \space x_n \space : \space T_n) \space \Rightarrow \space E \space \space \equiv \space \space \text{def} \space f(x_1 \space : \space T_1, \space ..., \space x_n \space : \space T_n) \space = \space E; \space f$$
where $f$ is an arbitrary new name.
Anonymous functions are thus [[1.2 Scala Basics#Syntactic Sugar|syntactic sugar]].
<hr>

Using anonymous functions we can further simplify our [[#Motivational Example - Sums|example]] in two cases:
```Scala
def sumInts(a: Int, b: Int)  = sum(x => x, a, b)
def sumCubes(a: Int, b: Int) = sum(x => x * x * x, a, b)
```
Note that `sumFacts` cannot be refactored in this way, as the factorial function requires recursion and thus an explicit name.

### Even Shorter Notation
#syntactic-sugar 

The following syntax is even more concise when defining simple anonymous functions:

```Scala
def binOp(f: (Int, Int) => Int)(a: Int, b: Int): Int =
	f(a, b)

val add = binOp(_ + _)
val mul = binOp(_ * _)
```

```Scala
scala> add(3, 4)
val res0: Int = 7

scala> mul(3, 4)
val res1: Int = 12
```
