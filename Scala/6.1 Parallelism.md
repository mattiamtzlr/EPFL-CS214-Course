# Background and Theory
> [!TLDR] TLDR
> Sequential computation: split tasks into multiple steps
> Parallelism: split the task into *independent* tasks (*fork*), solve them in parallel and then combine them again (*join*).

Parallelism is the concept of multiple computations happening *at once* (*simultaneously*) in physically different (parts of) devices.

Examples:
- connected computers (clusters, clouds)
- multiple cores in one chip (mainly CPU) or hundreds of threads on a GPU.
- FPGA's
- vector instructions with up to 512 bits

## Parallel vs Sequential Programming

Difficulties of parallel programming:
- Subsumes (includes, absorbs) sequential programming
- Specifying which parts of computation are or can be made independent.
- Different hardware (parts) need to communicate, thus its efficiency also depends on hardware details.

We need parallelism, as we can no longer really increase CPU clock frequency, as they would generate way too much heat.
With parallelism, we can use multiple cores at once running at a lower frequency, thus consuming *less power* and generating *less heat*. This is also great for mobile devices.

## Scala Threads
Threads in Scala are used to parallelize computations:
```Scala
var result = 0
class MyThread(val k: Int) extends Thread:
	override def run: Unit =
	var i: Int = 0
	while i < 6 do
		println(f”${getName} has counter ${i}”)
		i += 1
		Thread.sleep(3)
	result = k

def testThread: Unit =
	val t1 = MyThread(0)
	val t2 = MyThread(1)
	t1.start; t2.start
	Thread.sleep(4)
	t1.join; t2.join
	println(f”result = ${result}”)
```
The above code starts to threads, one with `k = 0` and one with `k = 1`. The threads both count up from 0 to 5 and print their current value at each iteration. At the end they set `result` to `k`.

### Race Conditions
*Race conditions* happen when a thread writes to a variable while another thread reads or writes to that variable.
This means that results can *change from run to run*.
Or, worse, the result can even be *ill-defined*, if the read takes long enough, a thread might read a half-old half-new value.

Generally, the "loser" of the race, i.e. the slower thread, decides the final value of the variable.

To avoid race conditions, threads are often synchronized using some sort of locking mechanism, this however can lead to *deadlocks*, where programs freeze.

This is not really a problem in Scala, if the programs are purely functional, thus there are no mutable variables.
For example, to compute
```
f(g(x), h(x))
```
we can compute `g(x)` and `h(x)` in parallel.
