#scala #parallelism 

Asynchronous computing commonly follows the pattern:
- launch a task that *takes some time*
- some time later, we need the result of the task
- if there are no side-effects, the task can be executed *concurrently* with the rest of the program.

This is beneficial, as we can use [[6.1 Parallelism|parallel computing resources]] to save time.

However, the classical *fork/join*-construct form parallel programming is close but too restrictive.

# The `Future` Construct
This topic will be split up into three parts, *simple* futures, *completable* futures and *direct-style* futures.

## 1. Simple Futures


## 2. Asynchronous Execution

### Inversion of Control


## 3. Direct-Style Futures
