# Class Hierarchies
[[2.3 Data and Classes#Classes|Classes]] in Scala can follow hierarchies similar to other languages. For this, multiple concepts are available, described in the following.

## Abstract Classes
*Abstract classes* can contain members who are missing an explicit implementation. This is used to create a kind of "framework" for other classes.
As an example, consider the following abstract class, representing a framework for writing classes representing sets of integers:
```Scala
abstract class IntSet:
	def contains(x: Int): Boolean
	def including(x: Int): IntSet
```

This also means, that it's not possible to directly instance an abstract class, for example an `IntSet()` call would be illegal.

### Class Extensions
Now, let's consider implementing sets as binary trees (why would you do that?). We need two different trees, one representing the empty set, and one consisting of an integer and two sub-trees:
```Scala
class Empty() extends IntSet:
	def contains(x: Int): Boolean = false
	def including(x: Int): IntSet = NonEmpty(s, Empty(), Emtpy())

class NonEmpty(elem: Int, left: IntSet, right: IntSet) extends IntSet:
	def contains(x: Int): Boolean =
		if x < elem then left.contains(x)
		else if x > elem then right.contains(x)
		else true

	def incl(x: Int): IntSet =
		if x < elem then NonEmpty(elem, left.incl(x), right)
		else if x > elem then NonEmpty(elem, left, right.incl(x))
		else this
end NonEmpty
```
#### Terminology
#terminology 

In the above example `Empty` and `NonEmpty` both *extend* the class `IntSet`. This implies that they *conform* to the type `IntSet`.
An object of type `Empty` or `NonEmpty` can be used wherever an object of type `IntSet` is required.

In our example about integer sets, the class `IntSet` is the *superclass* of `Empty` and `NonEmpty`. Conversely, `Empty` and `NonEmpty` are *subclasses* of `IntSet`. 

In Scala, any user-defined class extends another class, even if none is given explicitly, as the standard class `java.lang.Object` is assumed.

All direct or indirect superclasses of a class `C` are called the *base classes* of `C`.
Thus, the base classes of `NonEmpty` include `IntSet` and `Object`.

The definition of `contains` and `including` in the classes `Empty` and `NonEmpty` *implement* the abstract functions in the base class `IntSet`.
It's nevertheless possible to *redefine* an existing, non-abstract definition in a subclass by using the `override` modifier.

### Objects and Companions
In many class hierarchies, including our example of integer sets, there are certain (sub-)classes which are really *singletons* and don't need to be an "entire" class.
For instance, the `Empty` subclass of `IntSet` is such a class of which there is really only a single one.
This can be completely expressed using an *object definition*:
```Scala
object Empty extends IntSet:
	def contains(x: Int): Boolean = false
	def including(x: Int): IntSet = NonEmpty(x, Empty, Empty)
end Empty
```
This defines a singleton object named `Empty`. All newly created `Empty` instances will actually just be this one.

Objects and classes can have the same name as they are stored in different *namespaces*. Classes live in the type namespace, whereas objects live in the term / value namespace.
If a class and object with the same name are given in the same source-file, they are called *companions*.

### Dynamic Binding
Object-oriented languages (including Scala) implement *dynamic method dispatch*, which means that code which is invoked by a method call depends on the runtime type of the object containing the method.
This is also known as *polymorphism*.

## Programs and `main` Methods
To create a standalone application in Scala, a *main method* needs to be provided, for instance the classic "Hello, World!" program:
```Scala
// Hello.scala

object Hello:
	def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = println("Hello World!")
```
This can then be started from the command-line using:
```bash
$ scala Hello.scala
```
 <hr>

There's also a more convenient way to do this by using a function annotated with @`main`. The function's parameters will then be used as command-line arguments:
```Scala
// Birthday.scala

@main def birthday(name: String, age: Int) =
	println(s"Happy birthday, $name! $age years old already!")
```
This can then be started from the command-line as follows:
```bash
$ scala Birthday.scala -- Peter 11
```

## Packages
Classes and objects are organized in *packages*, which can be defined using the `package` clause at the top of a source-file:
```Scala
package week3.examples
object Hello
	...
```
which places `Hello` in the `week3.examples` package where it can then be accessed using `week3.examples.Hello`.

### Imports
Imports don't have to be at the top of the program, they could for instance be in a method, if the imported stuff is only used there.

Imports come in several forms:
1. The *named import* specifying one target only:
	```Scala
	import week2.Rational
	```
2. The *named import* specifying multiple targets:
	```Scala
	import week3.{IntSet, Hello}
	```
3. The *wildcard import* specifying all targets in a given package:
	```Scala
	import week1.*
	```

Imports can also alias the name of the imported stuff:
```Scala
import scala.math.{Pi => ðŸ¥§}
```
which can be more concise if a long name is repeatedly used.

#### Automatic Imports
The following entities are automatically imported in any Scala program:
- `scala.*`
- `java.lang.*`
- `scala.Predef.*` which includes `require` and `assert`.

## Special Types
At the very top of the Scala class hierarchy are the following special types:
- `Any`, the base type of all types and methods.
- `AnyRef`, the base type of all reference types, the equivalent of `java.lang.Object`.
- `AnyVal`, the base type of all primitive types.

In contrast, at the very bottom of the class hierarchy there is the `Nothing` type which is a default subtype of every other type. Even though there is no value of type `Nothing`, the type is still useful, for example to signal abnormal termination.
