# Context
*Context* describes further details of something which is given, *con* meaning "with" in latin.

In programming, context might describe:
- the current configuration
- the current scope
- the meaning of `<` on a type
- the user on behalf of which the operation is performed
- the security level in effect

Code becomes more *modular*, if it can *abstract* over context, that is functions and classes can be written without knowing and thus relying on the context in which they will be used.

## Functional Context Representation
In functional programming, the natural way to abstract over context is with function parameters. Advantages:
- flexible
- types are checked
- not relying on side effects

But this also has drawbacks, it can lead to:
- many function arguments
- which hardly ever change
- repetitive, errors are hard to spot

### Example: Sorting
Consider a generic sorting method with the following signature:
```Scala
def sort[T](xs: List[T]): List[T] = ...
```

This doesn't work, because there is no single comparison method `<`, which works for all types.
This is a problem of *missing context*, which can be solved by passing an ordering operation as an additional parameter:
```Scala
import scala.math.Ordering
def sort[T](xs: List[T])(ord: Ordering[T]): List[T] = 
  ...
  if ord.lt(x, y) then ...
  ...
```
which can now be used as follows:
```Scala
sort(ints)(Ordering.Int)
sort(strings)(Ordering.String)
```

---

This is still not ideal though, as we almost always pass the same `Ordering` instance for the same type. We can make this more concise by using *implicit parameters*.

# Scala Implicit Parameters
#syntactic-sugar 

Implicit parameters of a function can be *omitted* when calling and are then *inferred* by the compiler based on context and type inference.

## The `using` Clause
We can make the `sort` function from before more concise by using a `using` clause in front of the `ord` parameter, making it *implicit*:
```Scala
import scala.math.Ordering
def sort[T](xs: List[T])(using ord: Ordering[T]): List[T] = ...
```
<br>

Then, when calling:
```Scala
sort(ints)
sort(strings)
```
the compiler infers the types:
```Scala
sort[Int](ints)
sort[String](strings)
```
and then the `ord` argument:
```Scala
sort[Int](ints)(using Ordering.Int)
sort[String](strings)(using Ordering.String)
```

---

`using` clauses can be freely mixed with regular parameters:
```Scala
def f(x: Int)(using a: A)(y: Boolean)(using b: B) = ...
f(x)(using a)(y)(using b)
```


## `given` Instances
For the previous example with the `sort` function to work, the `Ordering.Int` definition must be a `given` instance:
```Scala
object Ordering:

  given Int: Ordering[Int] with
    def compare(x: Int, y: Int): Int =
      if x < y then -1 else if x > y then 1 else 0
```
which defines a `given` instance of type `Ordering[Int]`, named `Int`.

`given` instances can be *anonymous* by omitting the instance name, the compiler will then *synthesize* a name for an anonymous instance.

We can refer to a named or anonymous `given` instance by its type:
```Scala
summon[Ordering[Int]]
```

## Implicit Parameter Resolution
Assume a function takes an implicit parameter of type `T`. The compiler will search a `given` instance which:
- has a type *compatible* with T
- is visible at the point of the function call, or is defined in a companion object *associated* with T.

If there is a single, *most specific instance*, it will be used as the actual argument for the inferred parameter, otherwise an error will be thrown.
This error can either report that no instance could be found, or that multiple *ambiguous* instances were found.

### Search Targets
The search for a `given` instance of type `T` includes:
- all `given` instances which are visible 
- all `given` instances found in companion objects associated with `T`, where *associated* means:
  - companion objects associated with any of `T`'s inherited types
  - companion objects associated with any type argument in `T`
  - if `T` is an inner class, the outer objects, in which it is embedded.

For an example, see slide 38:
![[scala-week10_2.pdf#page=38]]

### Importing `given` Instances
There are three ways to import a `given` instance, the second one being the preferred one, since it's most informative:
```Scala
// 1. By-name:
import scala.math.Ordering.Int

// 2. By-type:
import scala.math.Ordering.{given Ordering[Int]}
import scala.math.Ordering.{given Ordering[?]}

// 3. With a wildcard:
import scala.math.give
```

### Priorities
If multiple `given` instances match the same type, they don't generate an ambiguity error if one is a *closer match* than the other.
Generally, a definition
```Scala
given a: A
```
is a closer match than a definition
```Scala
given b: B
```
if:
- a is in a closer lexical scope than b, or
- a is defined in a class or object which is a subclass of the class defining b, or
- type A is a generic instance of type B, or
- type A is a subtype of type B.

### Conditional Instances
**Question:** How do we define an `Ordering` instance for lists?
**Answer:** &nbsp; This can only be done if the list elements have an `Ordering`.

Thus:
```Scala
given listOrdering[A](using ord: Ordering[A]): Ordering[List[A]] with

  def compare(xs: List[A], ys: List[A]) = (xs, ys) match
    case (Nil, Nil) => 0
    case (Nil, _)   => -1
    case (_, Nil)   => 1
    case (x :: xs1, y :: ys1) =>
      val c = ord.compare(x, y)
      if c != 0 then c else compare(xs1, ys1)
```
which *takes type parameters and implicit parameters*.

Such `given` instances are *conditional*:
> An ordering for lists with elements of type `T` exists only if there is an ordering for `T`.

These `given` instances are resolved and inferred recursively.

# Summary
In this, we have introduced a way to do *type-directed programming*, with the help of a language mechanism that infers *values* from *types*.

There has to be a *unique* (most specific) given instance matching the queried type for it to be used by the compiler.

Given instances are searched in the enclosing *lexical scope* (imports, parameters, inherited members) as well as in the companion objects associated with the queried type.
