Our approach to [[6.1 Parallelism|parallelism]] is going to focus mainly on using *parallel collections*.

# Scala Parallel Collections
To turn a Scala collection into a parallel collection, the `.par` construct is used, included in the *Scala Parallel Collections Library*. To use it, the following must be included in `build.sbt`:
```Scala
libraryDependencies ++=
	Seq("org.scala-lang.modules" %% "scala-parallel-collections" % "1.0.3")
```

Then, use the following import:
```Scala
import scala.collection.parallel.CollectionConverters.*
```

> [!INFO]- The `.par` construct
> This construct gets added by the above import, and adds a `.par` method to most Scala collections.
>
> If applied to a collection, it turns that collection into a parallel collection, which supports the same operations, but it tries to do them in parallel using multiple CPU cores.
>
> Some examples:
> 
> ```Scala
> val r = (1 until 10)
  -> r: Range
> val rPar = r.par
  -> rPar: ParRange
>
> val a = Array.tabulate(3)(i => i + 2).par
  -> a: ParArray[Int]
>```

## Example: Matrix Multiplication
First, let's define a generic `Matrix` type, which is actually just a two-dimensional array:
```Scala
type Matrix[A] = Array[Array[A]]
```
<br>

Secondly, define a `prod` method which takes two matrices `m1`, `m2` and two indices `i`, `j`, to calculate the element at `(i, j)` in the product matrix `m1 * m2`:
```Scala
def prod[T](m1: Matrix[T], m2: Matrix[T])(i: Int, j: Int): T
```
which should implement the following functionality:
$$
\sum_k{m_1(i)(k) * m_2(k)(j)}
$$
which could be done with a simple loop.

<br>

Finally, we can implement the parallel matrix multiplication function:
```Scala
def parallelMultiply[T](m1: Matrix[T], m2: Matrix[T]): Matrix[T] =
	(0 until m1.length).par.map(
		i => Array.tabulate(m2(0).length)(j => prod(m1, m2)(i, j))
	).toArray
```
where the key point is the usage of the `.par` construct on the second line.

## Example: `parallel(e1, e2)`
We can write a simple function `parallel` which takes two expressions `e1` and `e2`,  evaluates them in parallel to `r1` and `r2` respectively and then returns both results in a pair `(r1, r2)`.

It can be visualised as follows:
```
 			 ┌────── e1 => r1 ──────┐
(e1, e2) o───┤ fork            join ├───> (r1, r2)
			 └────── e2 => r2 ──────┘
```

The function is implemented using a `ParArray`, the parallel equivalent of an array:
```Scala
def parallel[A](e1: => A, e2: => A): (A, A) =
	val both = ParArry(() => e1, () => e2).map(f => f())
	(both(0), both(1))
```

### Unbounded Number of Threads
What about more than two threads?
For instance, with 4 threads the visualisation would be as follows:
```
						 ┌────── e1 => r1 ──────┐
					 ┌───┤ fork            join ├───┐
					 │   └────── e2 => r2 ──────┘   │
(e1, e2, e3, e4) o───┤ fork                    join ├───> (r1, r2, r3, r4)
					 │	 ┌────── e3 => r3 ──────┐   │
					 └───┤ fork            join ├───┘
					     └────── e4 => r4 ──────┘    
```

There is a recursive way to extend this process to arbitrarily many threads (or until the processor runs out). It's usually done by splitting the task into many smaller subtasks until a manageable size is reached.
