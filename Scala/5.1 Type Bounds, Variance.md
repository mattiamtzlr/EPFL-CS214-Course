Consider we want to write a method `assertAllPos` which takes an `IntSet` and returns it unchanged if all elements are positive. Otherwise it throws an exception.
On first thought, the function signature could be the following:
```Scala
def assertAllPos(s: IntSet): IntSet = ...
```
What if we wanted to pass a [[3.1 Hierarchies, Objects#Class Extensions|subtype]] of `IntSet` such as `Empty` to this function?

# Type Bounds
#terminology 

To solve the above mentioned problem we could define `assertAllPos` in the following way:
```Scala
def assertAllPos[S <: IntSet](r: S): S = ...
```
Where `S <: IntSet` declares `IntSet` as an *upper bound* of the type parameter `S`.
This means, that `S` can be instantiated only to types that *conform* to `IntSet`.

## Types of Bounds
Generally, there are three types of bounds:
- Upper: `S <: T` means `S` is a *subtype* of `T`, as seen before.
<br>
- Lower: `S >: T` means `S` is a *supertype* of `T`
  This could for example be used like `[S >: NonEmpty]` which means that `S` could be one of the supertypes of `NonEmpty`, namely `NonEmpty` itself, `IntSet`, `AnyRef` or `Any`.
<br>
- Mixed: `S >: L <: U` means `S` is restricted to any type on the interval between `L` and `U`.

# Variance
There is another interaction between subtypes and type parameters worth considering:
Given 
```Scala
NonEmpty <: IntSet
```
does it follow that
```Scala
List[NonEmpty] <: List[IntSet]
```
is true? Intuitively this should be true, however it's not always given.
Types for which this relationship holds are called *covariant*. We'll exactly define it shortly.

## The Liskov Substitution Principle
> "Let `q(x)` be a property provable about objects `x` of type `B`. Then
`q(y)` should be provable for objects `y` of type `A` where `A <: B`."

Or, put more simply:
> If `A <: B`, then everything one can do with a value of type `B`
one should also be able to do with a value of type `A`.

The following code "breaks" the Liskov Principle:
```Scala
val a: Array[NonEmpty] = Array(NonEmpty(1, Empty(), Empty()))
val b: Array[IntSet] = a
b(0) = Empty()
val s: NonEmpty = a(0)
```
which produces a type error in line 2, as Arrays are indeed not *covariant*, due to their implementation.

## Definition of Variance
#terminology 

As we have seen, some types should be covariant whereas others should not. In general, types that accept *mutations of their elements* should **not** be covariant.
But immutable types can be covariant, if some conditions are met.

Let `C[T]` be a parameterized type and let `A`, `B` be types such that `A <: B`. Then there are *three* possible relationships between `C[A]` and `C[B]`:
- **C is covariant**: `C[A] <: C[B]`
- **C is contravariant**: `C[A] >: C[B]`
- **C is nonvariant**: Neither `C[A] >: C[B]` nor `C[A] <: C[B]`

In Scala, the variance of a type can be declared by annotating the type parameter:
- **C is covariant**: `class C[+A]{...}`
- **C is contravariant**: `class C[-A]{...}`
- **C is nonvariant**: `class C[A]{...}`

### Typing Rules for Functions
Generally, the following rule for subtyping between function types holds:
If `A2 <: A1` and `B1 <: B2`, then
```Scala
A1 => B1 <: A2 => B2
```
which means that functions are **contravariant** in their argument types(s) and **covariant** in their result type.

This can also be seen in their definition:
```Scala
package scala
trait Function1[-T, +U] {
	def apply(x: T): U
}
```

#### Example
```Scala
trait Fruit
class Apple extends Fruit
class Orange extends Fruit

type A = Fruit => Orange
type B = Apple => Fruit
```
In this case, as `Apple <: Fruit` and `Fruit >: Orange` we have that 
```Scala
B <: A
```

## Variance Checks
Roughly speaking, the Scala compiler will check the following possibly problematic variance annotations:
- *covariant* type parameters can only appear in *method results*, 
- *contravariant* type parameters can only appear in *method parameters*,
- *nonvariant* type parameters can appear everywhere.

Also for type bounds:
- *covariant* type parameters may appear in *lower bounds*,
- *contravariant* type parameters may appear in *upper bounds*.
