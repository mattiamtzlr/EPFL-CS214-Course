Until now, everything we have done in Scala has been immutable, meaning values never changed and everything was basically stateless.

# Imperative Scala Constructs
To declare a *mutable variable* in Scala use the `var` construct. So instead of 
```Scala
val a = 42 // 42 forever
```
we can do the following:
```Scala
var a = 42 // 42 initially
a = a + 3  // 45 currently
```

However, these values don't update. For example, using `a` from above:
```Scala
var b = a + 4 // b has initial value 49
a = a + 1     // a has current value 46, but b still has current value 49
```

## Imperative Applications
In the following, some applications of imperative constructs and variables are shown

### Local Variables: While Loop
```Scala
// multiplies x and y together
def mul(x: BigInt, y: BigInt): BigInt = {
  require(y >= 0)
  var bound = y
  var res: BigInt = 0

  while bound > 0 do // only makes sense if condition changes
    res = res + x
    bound -= 1

  res
}.ensuring(_ == x * y)
```

### Classes with Mutable Fields
```Scala
case class Planet(var x: Double, var y: Double, var z: Double)
val p = Planet(2.0, 5.0, -3.0)

p.x = p.x + 9.5 // add 9.5 to x coordinate of p
```
Note: the `Planet` object `p` is still immutable, its reference cannot be changed but the values / references of its mutable fields can be.

### Arrays & Mutable Collections
Arrays are themselves immutable (if declared with `val`), but their entries are always mutable.
```Scala
> val a = Array(1, 2, 3)
  -> val a: Array[Int] = Array(1, 2, 3)

> a(1) = 5
> a
  -> val res0: Array[Int] = Array(1, 5, 3)
```
Arrays are very efficient, as they don't have to copy state.
An empty array can be initialised with the `new` construct from Java:
```Scala
> val d = new Array[Int](5)
  -> val d: Array[Int] = Array(0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
```

Mutable collections can be imported:
```Scala
import scala.collection.mutable.*

val b: ListBuffer[Int] = ListBuffer(3) // b initially contains 3
b.addOne(42)                           // b now contains 3, 42

b ++= ListBuffer(37, 13, 101)          // b now contains 3, 42, 37, 13, 101
```
