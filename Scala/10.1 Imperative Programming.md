Until now, everything we have done in Scala has been immutable, meaning values never changed and everything was basically stateless.

# Imperative Scala Constructs
To declare a *mutable variable* in Scala use the `var` construct. So instead of 
```Scala
val a = 42 // 42 forever
```
we can do the following:
```Scala
var a = 42 // 42 initially
a = a + 3  // 45 currently
```

However, these values don't update. For example, using `a` from above:
```Scala
var b = a + 4 // b has initial value 49
a = a + 1     // a has current value 46, but b still has current value 49
```
