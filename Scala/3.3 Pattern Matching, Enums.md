# Pattern Matching
For this topic, we'll continue using the [[3.2 Traits, Decomposition#Decomposition - Example Expressions|example about expressions]] devised earlier.
As a reminder, we are trying to create a [[3.1 Hierarchies, Objects#Class Hierarchies|class hierarchy]] for representing simple mathematical expressions and their evaluations.
We have arrived at the following solution so far which uses [[3.2 Traits, Decomposition#Solution 1 Object-Oriented Decomposition|object-oriented decomposition]]:
```Scala
trait Expr:
	def eval: Int

class Number(n: Int) extends Expr:
	def eval: Int = n

class Sum(e1: Expr, e2: Expr) extends Expr:
	def eval: Int = e1.eval + e2.eval
```
However, we are still running into some problems.
