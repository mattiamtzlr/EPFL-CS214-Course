# Side Effects to Imperative Programming
When we have mutation in our code, to understand what a function or structure does, we need to know exactly its:
- inputs:
  - parameter list
  - **reads: additional visible names used**
    <br>

- output: 
  - return value
    <br>

- side effects: 
  - **modifies: changes to state**
    <br>

For example:
```Scala
var logBuffer: String = ""

def log(msg: String): Unit =
  // reads: logBuffer; modifies: logBuffer
  logBuffer = logBuffer + msg + "\n"

def sort(l: List[Int]): List[Int] =
  // reads: logBuffer, threshold; modifies: logBuffer
  if l.length < threshold then insertionSort(l)
  else log("large list, using merge sort")
    mergeSort(l)
```

**Mutable state ruins mathematical reasoning**, suddenly, it could be the case that 
```
x == x
```
no longer holds.
This could be, for example, because `x` relies on a counter which gets increased every time `x` gets evaluated.

Thus, we need to come up with a solution, to still be able to mathematically reason about epressions.

## Explicit Arguments and Returns
One approach to solving the above problem is explicitly defining all arguments and return values to / of a function. This means integrating any possible side effects (reads, modifies) into the function signature.

Details and examples can be found on slides 29 - 35:
![[scala-week10_1.pdf#page=29]]

## Hoare Logic
Another, more mathematical approach is a special case of [dynamic logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_logic_(modal_logic)), called *Hoare logic*.

Until now, we have seen [[7.A Functional Data Structures#Specifications of Data Structures|function specification]]. Hoare triples are a mathematical definition of this.

### Hoare Triples
Statements of Hoare logic are triples: `(pre, body, post)`

> [!example]- Notation
> Often, Hoare triples are denoted `{pre} body {post}` *or* `pre {body} post`.

To say that a Hoare triple **holds**, means:
> If `pre` holds in some state, then `post` holds after `body` executes from that state.

#### Example: Proof of Multiplication
We can use Hoare Triples to prove that the [[10.1 Imperative Programming#Local Variables While Loop|multiplication function]] defined before holds:
```Scala
def mulHoare(x: BigInt, y: BigInt): BigInt = {
  require(y >= 0)
  var bound = y
  var res: BigInt = 0
  assert(bound == y && res == 0)

  while bound > 0 do
    assert(res == (y - bound)*x && bound > 0)
    res = res + x; bound -= 1
    assert(res == (y - bound)*x && bound >= 0) // loop invariant

  assert(res == (y - bound)*x && bound == 0)
  res
} ensuring(_ == x * y)
```

### Hoare Logic Rules
In the following, common rules for Hoare logic are presented.
These are useful to combine multiple triples into one, ore to create triples altogether.

#### Sequence of Statements
```
assert(p)           assert(q)
s1                  s2
assert(q)           assert(r)
-----------------------------
          assert(p)
          s1
          s2
          assert(r)
```

#### While Loop
```
assert(p && cond)
body
assert(p)
------------------
assert(p)
while cond do
  body
assert(p && !cond)
```

#### If Statement
```
assert(p && cond)              assert(p && !cond)
s1                             s2
assert(q)                      assert(q)
-------------------------------------------------
                  assert(p)
                  if cond then 
                    s1
                  else
                    s2
                  assert(q)
```

#### Weakening
```
assert(p)            p1 => p
s
assert(q)            q  => q1
-----------------------------
          assert(p1)
          s
          assert(q1)
```

#### Assignment Statement
```
assert(p(e))
x = e
assert(p(x))
```
This is mainly intended for simple local `var`'s storing values like `Int`, not for mutable data structures.
