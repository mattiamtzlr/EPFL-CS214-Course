To motivate this topic, we will once again use the example developed in [[2.1 Higher-Order Functions]]:
```Scala
def sum(f: Int => Int, a: Int, b: Int): Int =
	if a > b then 0
	else f(a) + sum(f, a + 1, b)

def sumInts(a: Int, b: Int)  = sum(x => x, a, b)
def sumCubes(a: Int, b: Int) = sum(x => x * x * x, a, b)
def sumFacts(a: Int, b: Int) = sum(fact, a, b)
```
where we used some factorial function `fact`.

# Functions returning Functions
The above code is still not ideal: The parameters `a` and `b` get passed unchanged from `sumInts`, `sumCubes` and `sumFacts` into `sum`.

We can get rid of these parameters by making `sum` return a function:
```Scala
def sum(f: Int => Int): (Int, Int) => Int =
	def sumF(a: Int, b: Int): Int =
		if a > b then 0
		else f(a) + sumF(a + 1, b)
	sumF
```
Thus, `sum` is now a function which returns a function of type `(Int, Int) => Int` which applies the given function parameter `f` and sums the results.

So now we can simplify even further:
```Scala
def sumInts  = sum(x => x)
def sumCubes = sum(x => x * x * x)
def sumFacts = sum(fact)
```
These functions can be applied like any other function:
```Scala
sumInts(5, 10) + sumCubes(3, 7)
```

We can make these function calls even simpler:
```Scala
sum(x => x)(5, 10) + sum(x => x * x * x)(3, 7)
```
which eliminates the creation of `sumInts` and so on.

## Multiple parameter lists
This is so useful in FP that there is special syntax for it in Scala. So, we can further simplify our `sum` function:
```Scala
def sum(f: Int => Int)(a: Int, b: Int): Int = 
	if a > b then 0 else f(a) + sum(f)(a + 1, b)
```
The usage stays the same.
<br>

The type of the function `sum` is 
```Scala
(Int => Int) => ((Int, Int) => Int)
```
which is equivalent to
```Scala
(Int => Int) => (Int, Int) => Int
```
thanks to function types associating to the right.

This style of definition and function application is called *currying*, named after [Haskell Brooks Curry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_Curry).
