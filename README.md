# Software Construction Course Notes
Course notes for EPFL CS-214  
**This repository is an obsidian vault. For best results, view it in Obsidian.**  

The slides are under copyright of the course, thus I cannot post them here.  
The internal links referring to them will therefore not work unless you download the slides yourself (assuming you're an EPFL student) and you store them in a folder called `Slides` in the top level directory.  
You will need to name the slides the same as the references in the notes, so generally `scala-weekX.pdf` and `soft-eng-weekX.pdf` respectively.
