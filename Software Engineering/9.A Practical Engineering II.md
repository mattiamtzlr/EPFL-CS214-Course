This second example of applied software engineering is about *webapps*.
This whole topic is strongly connected to [[5.A Specifications]] and [[4.B Testing Techniques]].

# Structure of a Webapp

&copy; EPFL CS-214 Course Team

If the *state* of a webapp is fully open, thus is not secret to any of the clients, it's called a *perfect information state*.
This is the case in chess for example, as both players are always perfectly informed about all events that happened in the game so far.


# Development of a Webapp
The development of a webapp follows very closely what we did when writing specifications.

## I. User Stories
Write down what every (type of) client wants from the webapp, for example players in a game, or administrators.
This is mainly about functionality seen by the user, not internal workings of the code.
Normally in the form of "As a \_\_\_, I want to be able to do \_\_\_".

## II. Requirements
Here, we define *states*, *actions* and *views*:

**States**:
The state of a webapp contains all information and data relevant to the apps functionality, for example a game board for a chess game, or which player plays white.

**Actions**:
Actions are requests made by the clients to the server, specifying what they want the server to do and how the state should consequently change.
In a game of chess, this could be the action `Nf3` which means move the knight to `f3`.

**Views**:
The server provides views of the state(s) to the clients, usually after every state change.
These views often include less information than the actual state, as some information might be kept secret from the clients.
This could be the current state of the game board in a game of chess.

---

This is also where we define *client and server interfaces* - code which handles the communication between the clients and the server.

## III. Logic
The main part of the webapp logic is composed of *transitions*.
Transitions are functions which change the state, usually called based on a action or at the end of a game, for example.

This is handled kind of like a FSM, which keeps track of the current state and any possible changes between those states.

## IV. UI
The webapp UI can either be simply text-based or can be traditionally written in HTML / CSS / JS.
What's important, is that the UI should **never** have access to the state, as that might contain sensitive data, to be kept secret from the clients.

## V. Tests
Usually, we write a lot of [[4.B Testing Techniques#4. Unit Tests|unit tests]] in a project. However, for a webapp, it is usually better to use [[4.B Testing Techniques#3. Integration Tests|integration tests]] as the functions in a webapp are highly interconnected and we can test the relation between views and events.

However, this might fail to catch some bugs.
