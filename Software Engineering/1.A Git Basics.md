# Version control systems
A VCS is for:
- tracking the evolution of text or code
- versioning, distributed development

but not for:
- bug tracking, code review
- testing, CI, deployment

## Software development with a VCS:
```
write code <-------+
  |                |
  V                |
debug              |
  |                |
  V                |
review changeset   |
  |                |
  V                |
write description  |
  |		           |
  V                |
save snapshot -----+
```

## Visualizing history
### format-patch
After [[1.2 Scala Basics#Creating a new Scala project|creating a new Scala project]] and adding the first commits, you can nicely format the most recent commit by using the command:
```bash
git format-patch HEAD~1
```
which will generate a text file, which can then be opened.
This file is actually a `.patch` file, which can also be "imported" by Git.

### shortlog
The command
```bash
git shortlog -since=[date]
```
can be used to get a short log overview of a repository since the given `[date]`.

### blame
The command 
```bash
git blame <file>
```
shows who changed the given `<file>` and what changes they did.

## Sharing single commits as patches
To "export" a single commit, use the `format-patch` command shown above.  
After having shared the commit, someone can integrate it in their project by using the
```bash
git am <file>
```
command.
