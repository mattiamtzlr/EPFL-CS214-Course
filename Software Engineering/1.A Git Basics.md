# Version control systems
A VCS is for:
- tracking the evolution of text or code
- versioning, distributed development

but not for:
- bug tracking, code review
- testing, CI, deployment

## Software development with a VCS:
```
write code <───────┐
  |                │
  V                │
debug              │
  |                │
  V                │
review changeset   │
  |                │
  V                │
write description  │
  |		             │
  V                │
save snapshot ─────┘
```

## Visualizing history
### format-patch
After creating a new git repo and adding the first commits, you can nicely format the most recent commit by using the command:
```bash
$ git format-patch HEAD~1
```
which will generate a text file, which can then be opened.
This file is actually a `.patch` file, which can also be "imported" by Git.

### shortlog
The command
```bash
$ git shortlog -since=[date]
```
can be used to get a short log overview of a repository since the given `[date]`.

### blame
The command 
```bash
$ git blame <file>
```
shows who changed the given `<file>` and what changes they did.

## Sharing single commits as patches
To "export" a single commit, use the `format-patch` command shown above.  
After having shared the commit, someone can integrate it in their project by using the
```bash
$ git am <file>
```
command.

## Logs and Tags
Running
```bash
$ git log
```
produces an output similar to the following:
```
commit 513ba551a660d75642f34f0a0f1a05b7f0d450cd (HEAD -> master, origin/master)
Author: Mattia <************************>
Date:   Sun Oct 20 22:38:55 2024 +0200

    General | update | some smallish changes during review

commit ae5dedd2a0a8b889be06dad97463b00e4539f053
Author: Mattia <************************>
Date:   Thu Oct 17 17:33:23 2024 +0200

    SoftEng: Week 6 | done | Finished notes

...
```
which shows the history of commits formatted as logs.
The long hex string at the beginning of every commit is that commit's *hash*, used to uniquely identify it.
<br>

As these hashes are not very catchy, we can use the following command
```bash
$ git tag -m "Version 1.0" v1.0
```
to  give the most recent commit the tag `v1.0` with the message `"Version 1.0"`.

If we now run `git log` again, we get the following output:
```
commit 513ba551a660d75642f34f0a0f1a05b7f0d450cd (HEAD -> master, tag: v1.0, origin/master)
Author: Mattia <************************>
Date:   Sun Oct 20 22:38:55 2024 +0200

...
```
where we can see in line 1, that the most recent commit has been tagged `v1.0`.
