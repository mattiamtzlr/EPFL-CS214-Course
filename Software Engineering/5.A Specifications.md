Before we can even start [[4.B Testing Techniques|testing]] our code, we need to know what we want from it and we expect it to do.
This is done by collecting *specifications*.

# 1. User Stories
Capture what users (customers) care about:
- Use a few words to capture the essence of the project
- User, topic, purpose => who, where, what

# 2. Requirements (reqs)
Complete description of the project.

## Functional Requirements:
Concrete, testable objectives, needed for basic functionality.

## Non-Functional Requirements:
General properties, used to make the project nice / easy to use and appealing to customers.

# 3. Specifications (specs)
Unambiguous functional requirements:
- Only covers functional requirements
- Can include functionality, performance, error handling, availability, ...
- **Unambiguous**

reqs are for **customers**, specs are for **engineers**.

# 4. Formal Specs
Tying it all together with math & code
- Like a spec, but written in a *restricted, unambiguous language*.
	- Math or code
	- Supports formal proofs

Formal specs are for **engineers and computers**

**Example**: the `ensuring` structure in Scala.

# Recap: specs and tests
- **User stories** capture the *who* (target audience) and *what* (needs and
goals)
- **Requirements** (functional / non-functional) are acceptance criteria
- **Specifications** restate requirements in detailed language
- **Formal specifications** capture requirements unambiguously for all
inputs
- **Acceptance and system tests** validate against requirements
- **Integration tests, unit tests, and monitors** validate against
specifications
