[[3.A Debugging Process|The debugging process]] devised in the recent lectures are very useful, however they can be made more powerful by understanding the following to concepts: Tracing and understanding stack usage.

We can use the `println` function to print a evaluation trace of a recursive function. Take for example the following `length[T]` function:
```Scala
def length[T](l: List[T]): Int = l match
	case Nil    => 0
	case _ :: t => 1 + length(t)
```

If we need to debug it, it can become annoying having to keep track of the values of everything. Thus by adding the following `println` statements,
```Scala
def length[T](l: List[T]): Int =
	println(f"-> $l")
	val res = l match
		case Nil    => 0
		case _ :: t => 1 + length(t)
	println(f"<- $res")
	res
```
we can get the following output:
```Scala
> length(1 :: 2 :: 3 :: Nil)
  -> List(1, 2, 3)
  -> List(2, 3)
  -> List(3)
  -> List()
  <- 0
  <- 1
  <- 2
  <- 3
```

However, we can make this even better by slightly modifying our function and `println` statements:
```Scala
def length[T](l: List[T], depth: String): Int =
	println(depth + f"-> $l")
	val res = l match
		case Nil    => 0
		case _ :: t => 1 + length(t, depth + "  ")
	println(depth + f"<- $res")
	res
```
which then gives us the following output:
```Scala
> length(1 :: 2 :: 3 :: Nil, "")
  -> List(1, 2, 3)
	-> List(2, 3)
	  -> List(3)
	    -> List()
	    <- 0
	  <- 1
	<- 2
  <- 3
```

This can also be applied to [[2.1 Higher-Order Functions#Higher-Order Functions (HOFs)|higher-order functions]], where other important info such as operators or current elements can be printed.

The above technique is also useful to understand how the stack fills up during program execution.
