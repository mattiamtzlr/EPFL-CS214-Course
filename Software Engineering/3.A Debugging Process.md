# TLDR - Guide to Debugging
![[guide-to-debugging.png]]
Debugging is a very detailed process not only applicable to programming, but to problem-solving in general which is also very useful when dealing with [[1.A Git Basics|Git]] :)

# Triage
Triage is the step of debugging mainly concerned with reproducing and narrowing-down the problem.

## 1. Confirm the Problem
- State the issue, this may be refined later.
- Compare to specs, documentations, requirements
- Is it obvious why the bad case is different from a good case?

## 2. Reproduce the Issue
- How often does it happen? Every time or just sometimes?
- For what inputs does it happen?
- Does it depend on system configuration?
- Are there diagnostics (logs, error messages)?
- Did it work previously? Check the previous versions and commit history.

## 3. Decide whether it's your Problem
- Do *I* need to fix it?
- Is it even worth fixing, or is a workaround sufficient?
- Does it need to be fixed *now*?

## 4. Write a Bug Report
- Check previous reports, known issues, bug databases.
- Find out where to report and check their guidelines.
- Write clearly and completely using a good title
	- Show the steps taken, results observed and expectations
	- Include system details, customization

# Diagnose & Fix
This is the part of debugging where the goal is to find out as much information about the problem and to try and fix it.

## 1. Learn about the System
- Consult documentations / manuals
	- Search for other relevant resources
- Figure out what you don't know
- Inform yourself about the relevant tools and software

## 2. Observe the Issue
- Try different inputs, configurations
	- Look for consequences further in the program or for reasons earlier in the program.
- **Read error messages**
- Add logging / tracing variables / print statements and rerun
	- Turn on errors and warnings
- Use the VCS history
- Read the code

## 3. Simplify and Minimize the Issue
- Simplify the inputs to the minimum that reproduces the bug
	- Shorten the test case
- Simplify the system to the minimum that reproduces the bug
	- Remove unnecessary code
	- Isolate the code
	- Check different machines
- Slow things down with delays or pauses
- Determinize the failure by using random seeds and stopping other processes
- Automate the failure by using tests

## 4. Guess and Verify
- Play scientist :)
	- Formulate a hypothesis
	- Design an experiment
	- Refine and narrow down the experiment and the issue

## 5. Fix and Confirm the Fix
- Decide whether to fix the problem by deciding whether it is in your scope or if a workaround would be preferable
- Apply the changes
- Revert other changes
- Confirm the fix
	- Rerun all tests

## 6. Prevent Regressions
- Document the resolution
	- Be detailed in commit messages, posts, READMEs
	- Include the root cause, the fix or workaround and eventual follow-ups
- Look for similar instances where the bug-fix might be applicable
- Add missing tests to prevent future regressions.
