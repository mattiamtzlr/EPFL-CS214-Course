#software-engineering #debugging 

While debugging code or a problem in general following the [[3.A Debugging Process|previously described procedure]], there are certain useful techniques and lots of dangerous pitfalls which are discussed further in the following.

# Techniques
## Keep Notes
- Write every change down
- Write your observations down
- Work on a different Git branch
- Keep decision trees, guesses and mind maps

## Change one Thing at a Time
- Needed to establish cause-effect relationships

## Apply the Scientific Method
- Write a conjecture (potential cause)
	- can be very broad
- Design an experiment
- Reject or accept

## Instrument
- Add `println` calls
- Write to logs

## Divide and Conquer
- Pinpoint the source using tests
- Inspect intermediate states
- Test components in isolation

## Ask for Help
- Experts
- Online
- Communities, Guides

# Pitfalls
- Random mutations
	- Changing things "until it works"
	<br>
	
- Staring aimlessly
- Guessing without verifying
	- Don't fix correct code
	<br>
	
- Wasting time
	- Experiments are too complex
	- Look out for signs of going down a rabbit hole
	- Quick checks
	<br>
	
- Assuming bug went away
	- At most they disappeared quickly
	<br>
	
- Focusing on the wrong thing
- Fixing effects, not causes
- Losing data
