This is a first example of applied software engineering, where we will do *signal processing* using [[7.1 Lazy Lists, Evaluation#Lazy Lists|lazy lists]].

# Physical Sound
In physical sound, we have a displacement of air over a certain amount of time:
$$
\text{displacement} = f(\text{time})
$$
![[physical_sound.png]]

This sound can then be *sampled*, which means recording the amount of displacement at a given timestamp, creating a discrete signal.

# Digital Sound
Digital sound is sampled as above, thus it is quantized:
$$
\text{amplitude}_t
$$
where $\text{amplitude}$ is the quantized sound and $t$ is the sampled time.

## Scala Representation
We'll use the following representation for a `Signal` type in Scala:
```Scala
type Signal = LazyList[Short]
```
As we want to be able to have an infinite sound, we use a `LazyList`. We use `Short` because their 16-bit length is appropriate for sound.
